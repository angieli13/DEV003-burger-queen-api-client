# Burger Queen (API Client)

## 1. Project Overview 

Burger Queen API Client is an application developed with [Angular](https://angular.io/), through which, burger restaurant waiters can see the menu, take orders through a Tablet and send them to the kitchen to be prepared in an orderly and efficient way, solving the same problem: how to keep the interface and state synchronized.
This project has two areas: interface (client) and API (server).
